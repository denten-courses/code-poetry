# Weasel Words
<sup>Code and Poetry 2014</sup>

Goal: Check your writing for clarity.

0. Create a new project directory.
1. Copy three of your past term papers (or anything else that you have written).
2. Convert to plain text.
3. Make a list of three "weasel words" and save to a file.
4. Write a `sed` script to replace the weasel words in place and create a backup file for safety.
5. Use `comm` or `diff` to compare the files.

Bonus: Your script should preserve capitalization.
