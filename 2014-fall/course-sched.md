## Course Description
For many, even for those with a technical education, computing remains an unreflective activity. Machines do things for us: they “process” words, “manage” content, and “serve” web pages. These agents, located at the core of human-computer interaction, shape our understanding of the each other and of the world in significant ways, and yet they remain opaque, obscured within the black boxes of restricted access and proprietary software.

The goal of this class is to bring our everyday encounter with technology into the light, to peel back the lid, and to take control. We will do this first by exploring the foundational concepts invoked in the discussion about new media: noise and information, data and metadata, artificial and natural languages, digital and analog media.

Second, we will build on these theoretical foundations to gain a measure of computational proficiency, learning about the basics of algorithmic thinking, computer architecture, internet infrastructure, file and operating systems, internet infrastructure, communication protocols, web standards, and cryptography.

Finally, we will contextualize our practice historically. The course will connect core concepts in computer science to long-standing problems posed by philosophy, literary theory, and social thought. 

No prior experience is required.
